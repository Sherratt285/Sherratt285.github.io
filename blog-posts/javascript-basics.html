		    The goal of this post is not to teach you JavaScript all in one go but to
		    get an idea of its place in web development and a high level over view of
		    what’s going on within it. To learn the syntax of JavaScript FreecodeCamp’s
		    basic JavaScript course is a very good place to start.

		    <h2>The relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript</h2>
		    <br><br>
		    Hyper-text markup language or HTML. Is the language that forms the
		    foundation of the internet. It describes the content of a web page, and
		    gives us tools for organizing that information such as lists, links,
		    dividers and classes. It is like the foundation and framework of a house it
		    shows us the walls, floor, rooms, doors and roof.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    The Cascading style sheet or CSS is a system that allows us to describe the
		    layout and look of a website. It allows us to precisely position html
		    elements, set text and background colors, set margins and control many
		    other property’s related to the layout and design. Continuing with our
		    house analogy it’s the paint job, and carpets of the house. It helps to
		    bring personality and organization to the web page.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    These two tools together can make a basic website, however there is a third
		    piece of the puzzle. This piece is JavaScript. JavaScript is a text based
		    object-oriented programming language that builds in interactivity between
		    the user and the website, along with the website and systems that operate
		    behind the scenes such as databases, algorithms, sales funnels and other
		    systems. If HTML is the foundations, and structure of the house and CSS is
		    the way it looks JavaScript is the houses plumbing, power and heating
		    systems.
		    <br/>

		    <h2>Control Flow</h2>
		    
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    Control flow describes the sequence of steps and decisions that the script
		    takes when it runs. This sequence can be altered using condition statements
		    that do something if a test is passed or do something else if it fails. To
		    do this we can use if/else and switch statements. But what if we need to
		    repeat a set of instructions or process? such as a baker preparing
		    baguettes. He will be following his process until he runs out of dough or
		    runs out of space in the oven. To do this we can use loops, which repeat a
		    process until a condition or conditions are met.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    using an example of booking a flight. First the passenger would select the
		    flight date. Then they would choose which flight they wanted to boon on,
		    probably based on flight time, departure and arrival time and price.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    once they had selected the flight, the next step in the sequence would be
		    to present all available seats. After that the passenger would select their
		    seat. The program would reserve that seat to avoid double booking. The
		    customer would then pay for the seat and the seat would change from
		    reserved to booked.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>

		    <h2>The DOM</h2>
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    The Document Object Model or DOM is an API that represents the contents of
		    an xml or html document as a tree structure. It can be used with any
		    programming language but is most commonly used with JavaScript. It allows
		    us to easily create, read and update content of a document by selecting the
		    element we want to manipulate and storing it in a variable.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    In other words, the DOM is an object-oriented representation of a webpage
		    that can be manipulated by an object-oriented language like JavaScript.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    In programming arrays are a list of data. In Javascript this data can be
		    any type of data that JavaScript can contain in a variable. Arrays consist
		    of a name and elements - where data is stored. The number of elements that
		    the array contains which actively store data is the size of the array. The
		    data is accessed by a number index, which always starts at 0.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    To access data from an array we use the array name and the element index we
		    are trying to access. We can then either manipulate the elements variable
		    as we would any other variable.
		    <br/>
		    Back to our flight booking example from flow control: airplaneSeat[ 13 ]
		    from the name we can read that the arrays describe the seats in an
		    aircraft. This element might tell us whether the 12<sup>th</sup> seat on
		    the plane is still available or if its booked, and. If so, any in-flight
		    extras the passenger has purchased.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    Similar to arrays, objects are an organized set of data which model real
		    world things.
		    <br/>
		    unlike arrays which use elements to store a sequence of data objects use
		    properties to organize data.
			</p>
			<p>
		    Building on the example above using the airplaneSeat array we could also
		    model customer data. Their name, age, contact information, and if they are
		    part of a loyalty program. This data can then also be stored in the seat
		    array at there booked seat once booking has been confirmed.
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    To access an object and its property’s first we need to know the object
		    name, then the property we are trying to update. If. Say, they weren’t part
		    of a loyalty program but then signed up. Instead of using the index like we
		    would an array we would need to select the property using either
		    object.property or object[property] so. passenger.airPoints = x; or
		    passenger[airPoints] = x;
		    <br/>

		    <h2>Functions</h2>
		    <br/>
		    <br/>
		    A function is a set of instructions that preform a single, well-defined
		    task. The function name should be concise and based on what it does. They
		    can receive, manipulate and either return variables or not return
		    variables. Functions exist to break down big, complex problems into smaller
		    problems that are much easier to understand and solve. I am working on a
		    separate post to go into functions in a lot more in depth – the whole idea
		    of functions really.
