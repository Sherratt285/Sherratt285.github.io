        <h3>Javascript Fundimentals</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Javascript, CSS and HTML</h4>
        <br><br>
        The web these days is mostly built around 3 languages.
        HTML, CSS and Javascript.

        in a nutshell HTML forms the skelton and structure of a web page. 
        <br>
        If the web where a house, then HTML would be the overall structure of the house - the foundations, floor, roof, and walls. 
        <br><br>
        If HTML is the structure its self then CSS is the way it looks, paint, vynal, wallpaper, carpets and curtians. With CSS we can see the character of the place come out. 
        <br><br>
        following along our house analogy Javascript is the hot water, light, power and heat. 
        <br><br>        
        <h4>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects </h4>
        <br><br>
        flow control describes how a program preforms the job it is trying to do.
        <br><br>
        Its broken up into loops, functions, and condition statements. These are fundamentally the same across many different languages. from JavaScript to back-end languages such as the C family (C, C++, C# (C-sharp)) and Java as languages that are commonly used in the industry today.
        <br><br>
        Loops preform a set of instructions that is repeated while a condition is true. 
        <br><br>
        There are two main types of loops found in programming. The For loop, and while loops. 
        <br><br>
        The For loop runs a set of code for a set number of times. It can count up or down. It exits the loop when the index reaches the maximum or minimum value.
        <br><br>
        While loops are loops that loop while a condition is true. To implement a while loop, the test condition is initialised as the first step before the loop, and preformed as the last instruction in the loop. This stops the loop from looping indefinitely.
        <br><br>
        do while loops are slightly different. They are a while loop but they will always execute the code inside the loop on the first pass through before checking the loop condition.
