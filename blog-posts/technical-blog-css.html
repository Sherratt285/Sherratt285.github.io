				<h3>What are the differences between fixed, relative and absolute positioning in CSS?</h3>
				<br><br>
				<p>
					On a 1920*1080 resolution display a computer screen is made up of 2,073,600 pixels. Exponentially more for higher resolutions which are becoming a lot more common. Across so much screen real estate how do HTML elements keep from being lost amongst the clutter – and especially when things change position and size, and when other elements are moving around them – which they do on a regular basis. 
					<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>
					If we just threw everything onto the page, without formatting html loads line by line. this is not such a problem when we are working with a straight text document. But when we introduce pictures, videos and other elements it very quickly become a garbled mess. It makes no difference to computers, but since the whole point of a website is to communicate information to a reader if elements piled over top and around each other on a whim they would quickly get frustrated and go somewhere else.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					fortunately CSS gives us developers a tool to help solve this dilemma. The positioning property. This  property sets how an element in CSS is positioned in a document.
					<br><br>
					There 5 pre-sets, but we will only look at 3 ways an element can be positioned in a document here.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Relative – the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
					this means we can move an element with this pre-set by choosing top, left, right and bottom by a specified number of pixels, and it will change its position in the document according to that pre-set.
					the issue is when it is moved, its moved relative to its normal position so it could conflict with other elements still in their normal position and they would have to be changed as well.
					<br><br>

					<br><br>
				<p>
					Absolute – the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.
					This means we can move an element to a new position and it won’t affect the elements around it
					<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>
					Fixed – the element is positioned related to the browser window. The difference between relative and and absolute positioning is that fixed a fixed image will not move when you scroll down the page. <br>Becasue absolute positioning is psotioned in relation to its parent element not the browser it will.

				<p>
					For the record the other two properties are static and sticky, but we are not going to look at them now.
