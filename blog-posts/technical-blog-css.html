				<h3>CSS Positioning</h3>

				<h3>What are the differences between fixed, relative and absolute positioning in CSS?</h3>
				<br><br>
				<p>
					How do pictures and other elements keep from coliding with eacher? <br>If we just threw everything onto the page, without formatting html loads line by line. HTML can handlole this when working with a text document, which can be pretty well formatted within HTML alone. <br>However, when we introduce pictures, videos and other elements it very quickly become a garbled mess. It makes no difference to computers, but since the whole point of a website is to communicate information to a reader. If elements piled over top and around each other on a whim they would quickly get frustrated and go somewhere else.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					fortunately CSS gives us a tool to help solve this dilemma. The positioning property. This  property sets how an element in CSS is positioned in a document.
					<br><br>
					There 5 pre-sets, but we will only look at 3 ways an element can be positioned in a document here.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Relative – the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
					this means we can move an element with this pre-set by choosing top, left, right and bottom by a specified number of pixels, and it will change its position in the document according to that pre-set.
					<br><br>
				</p>

					<br><br>
				<p>
					Absolute – the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.
					This means we can move an element to a new position and it won’t affect the elements around it.
					<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>
					Fixed – the element is positioned related to the browser window. This means that the document can move around and the element stays in a fixed position on the screen. 
				</p>

				<p>
					For those curious: the final element is the stickey element. The element maintains its relitive position, untill it the browser moves past a pre-set point. When that happens the element maintains a new fixed position while the rest of the document sails past.
