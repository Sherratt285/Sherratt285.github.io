			    Problem solving.
			    <br/>
			    26/09/2021
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    For this post the goal is to reflect on a problem we faced this week and
			    techniques we used to solve it.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    When redesigning my blog over the past few days, I had everything set up
			    and working on all pages within the blog. When I loaded up the first post
			    into the new layout using grids. I found the footer had gotten involved
			    with the core list grid, and only on this page.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <img
			        src="file:///C:/Users/Sherratt/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png"
			        width="270"
			        height="184"
			    />
			    <img
			        src="file:///C:/Users/Sherratt/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.png"
			        width="302"
			        height="129"
			    />
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    This had me totally stumped. Not interested in spending hours trying to
			    figure out what was going on, I decided to call it an evening. Later on I
			    was doing the dishes and had an epiphany. Html inheritance. If a class is a
			    child class it inherits the properties of its parent. In order to further
			    brake up the page for the page links I had set up the content class from
			    the HTML below as an inner grid. (The footer class is the misbehaving one.)
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    If the footer was part of this grid, it must be reading the grid properties
			    from the content class instead of the main grid container as it should be.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    Eager to test this theory I loaded up my text editor to the problem page. I
			    scrolled down to the footer. Hmm. There seems to be a lot of closing
			    dividers down the bottom.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <img
			        src="file:///C:/Users/Sherratt/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.png"
			        width="601"
			        height="234"/>
			</p>
			<p>
			    <br/>
			    Sublime’s showed me which dividers were connected to which closing dividers
			    with the orange underline. Sure enough.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <img
			        src="file:///C:/Users/Sherratt/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.png"
			        width="602"
			        height="295"/>
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    look at the orange underline on line 45. thanks This divider on line 45 .
			    HTML was reading the footer class as part of the content class on line 23,
			    which we can see also underlined with the same orange line. Whereas, I
			    wanted to be part of the main grid container class.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    Fortunately the solution was simple, just cut and past line 45 to between
			    36 and 39. After the core posts class so that would be part of the content
			    class, but before the footer class so footer would not.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    One save, and refresh later. Horary, it worked. I wouldn’t say in this case
			    I used specific problem-solving strategies, it was more a case of letting
			    myself rest as I was tired, and mulling it over in the background.
