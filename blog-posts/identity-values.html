				<br><br><h3>Describe your core personal values</h3>
				<br>
				I’ll be honest, this is the first time I’ve written a blog/diary so it will definitely take some getting used to.
				<br><br>
				Who I am and my values is something I am very much in the process of exploring and understanding. Growing up in a small town on a vineyard and practicing martial arts for the last 11 years has definitely shaped my values to this point. Liberty, Integrity, Honesty, Respect, Discipline, working together and community are all a big part of who I am.
				<br><br>
				I think a couple of strengths that might help me in my learning journey are my curiosity, perseverance, persistence and humility. Something that will take some getting used to is the strategy of breadth of knowledge over depth of knowledge. I can find myself spending quite a long time lost in thought and mulling over, over thinking things. 
				<br><br>
				<h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </h3>
				<br>
				Last year I found myself going out to get some lunch. On my way out down Kent Terrace I came across an assault. One pretty big guy with a cut on his head was attacking another guy, who was trying to get away. But unable to defend himself. 
				<br><br>
				I had a decision to make. Carry on my way and, knowing me beat myself up over it later. Or intervene. Having my background in martial arts, I pretty quickly decided to intervene.
				<br><br>
				I let them come a bit closer, using the time to figure out how different options might play out and how to intervene safely. I called out to him to cut it out. He didn’t hear me. Great, I thought. I’m going to have to use force. I called out again, and this time he heard. He took one glance at me, ready to go and immediately broke it off. 
				<br><br>
				The other guy was rattled but unhurt and got on his way, while I took a few minutes to calm down. 
				<br><br>
				<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
				<br>
				I am very honest, and persistent. I'm also very creative and clever when Im dealig with a farmilliar play book. But I can be very one track minded at times. I can also struggle to see the way forward when dealing with an unfamiliar pathway. I do need to work on asking questions in order to limit that ambiguity to make it easier for me to apply my existing tool set to more unfamiliar problems.
				<br>
				I think I may have developed that response to help cope with analyses paralysis as a result of having too many options, and struggling to let go of the other options when I have picked one. 
				<br><br>
				<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h3>
				<br>
				A situation I found myself in - that left a deep impact on me - was while I was studying at Weltec. An important part of the course I was on involved a final group project. I formed a group with two others and we set out to build a weather station. 
				<br><br>
				Right from the start there was tension. One member had already started prototyping before we had even started, and we did not really establish boundaries or our individual expectations. On the eve of a proposal sign, we had tried to meet which I was unable to make due to my location and logistics at the time. I found out after the weekend that they had joined up and completed a majority of the work without me, which left me feeling hurt and excluded. 
				<br><br>
				Our project coordinator quickly stepped in and attempted to reassign workload. I was able to complete the work assigned and we tried to get together and set up expectations, but the damage was done and the group split apart.
				<br><br>
				I found out after that right from the start the other two had big doubts about whether I had the technical skills in order to be an effective team member. Instead of voicing their concerns and allowing a discussion to take place, they kept it to themselves. I have been trying to figure out how I would do things differently and one of them is set up expectations of openness and honesty early. With this specific scenario. While I felt something was off. Without knowing the problem, I still wonder whether we could have effectively worked out a solution.
