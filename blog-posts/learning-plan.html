          <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          <br><br>
          I am working towards front end or full stack web development. I have studied some back end using C++, and am familiar with databases. I also love aviation so I may attempt to get into the aerospace industry at some ponit.
          <br><br>
          <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
          <br><br>
          One of the things I have noticed is I struggle to stay motivated with arbitrary goals. I learn best when I am working on a project that is aiming to solve a problem.
          I am at the point where I can comfortably reference language documentation for syntax when needed. When I am just learning coding without building a project, I  easilly get bored. However I am also the type of person who can very easily spend too long trying to figure out a problem, so I need to learn to see when something is good enough, so I can continue to move on and not get bogged down with details and specifics.
          <br><br>
          <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2> 
          <br><br>
          Team work in a software development environment.
          <br><br>
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
          <br><br>
          At the moment I am aiming for 4-5 hours of study per day, setting aside time for exercise. I am finding I am starting to get quite pressed for time though,
          so I need to put in more time throughout the week, so I don’t end up working through weekends.
          <br>
          I am also limiting coffee and alcohol intake in general and exercising regularly.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
          <br><br>
          I do like to take some time off during the middle of the day to exercise.
          <br><br>
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
          <br><br>
          Open and honest communication is the main thing.
