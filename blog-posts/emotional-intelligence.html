			    <strong>Introduction</strong>
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    At our core humans are social creatures - our society is built around
			    teamwork after all. Teamwork is what allowed us to become the dominant
			    species on this planet. Many hands make light work after all, and cover
			    each-others different strengths and weaknesses.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    Fortunately, the skills that allow us to work effectively in teams can be
			    learnt – they are critical to our survival after all. This set of skills is
			    referred to as EI or Emotional Intelligence.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>EI</strong>
			    or Emotional intelligence is our ability to understand, express and control
			    our emotions, and understand the emotions of others. It helps us resolve
			    conflicts, and effectively work with other people.
			    <br/>
			    EI is normally built around for parts.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>self Management</strong>
			    - or our ability to control impulsive feelings and manage our emotions in a
			    constructive way and adapt to changing circumstances.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>Self Awareness </strong>
			    – our awareness of our own emotions and how they effect our behaviour.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>Social Awareness</strong>
			    – our understanding of the emotions and concerns of other people – or
			    empathy.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>Relationship Management</strong>
			    – how we develop and maintain relationships, resolve conflicts, and work
			    together as a team.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>IQ </strong>
			    or Intelligence Quotient. The idea is to measure someone’s problem solving
			    and reasoning ability to provide a guidance on which kind of job they might
			    be suited for. This is found using a sequence of tests based on short term
			    and long term memory, under a time limit which creates a stress factor. And
			    represented as a score.
			    <strong>
			        <br/>
			    </strong>
			    While it can be an interesting insight into someone’s strengths and
			    weaknesses, it is no indicator for success. As there are many other
			    personality, and environmental factors at play.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    In summery. Emotional intelligence is our ability to be aware of and
			    control (to an extent) our emotions, and the emotions of others and is
			    definitely something we can learn. IQ is a measure of our ability to solve
			    problems using logic and reasoning. Both are useful measurements that can
			    help to gauge someone’s suitability for a particular position in society.
			    But. It is important to remember they are only guidelines, and as the
			    saying goes “it’s not over until the fat lady sings.”
