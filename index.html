    <p>
        Hello all,
        <br><br>
        My name is Sherratt Pemberton.
        <br><br>
        I am in the very windy Mt Victoria in Wellington. I grew up on a small familly run vineyard in Martinborough
        <br><br>
        I am still definitly working on understanding and exploring my values - and am not very used to writing down my thoughts like this- but who I am has defenitly been shaped through the ebb and flow of living and working on a vineyard in a small town. I value integrity, honesty, respect, humility, independence and community.
        <br><br>
        I am attending Dev academy because I love the challange, creativity and flexability involved with programming. Although I was/am very torn about trying to get into aviation maybe at some point in the future.
